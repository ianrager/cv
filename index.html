        <h1>Ian Rager</h1>
        <p><em><strong>Jack of all trades, master of none</strong> (still often better than a <strong>master of one</strong>).</em></p>
        <p>Born in Las Vegas, Nevada, I spent my first 11 years of my life there.</p>
        <p>Then, in 2012, I moved to Colorado. It was a turbulent transition to say the least.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, in High School, I had the
          <a href="https://sites.google.com/jeffcoschools.us/wrhs-gt/home">GT Center</a></strong>, which was certainly a life-saver, in more
          ways than one.
        </p>
        <p>
          After High School, I took a "breather" for a whole year, then took one semester and one class (ENG 121) at Red Rocks Community College. I took only one semester and one class because:
        </p>
        <ol type=A>
          <li>I wasn't entirely sure about whether I wanted to go to college, so I was basically dipping my toe in the waters of college.</li>
          <p>and</p>
          <li>As I later discovered, I severely lacked the funds for any further courses.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          I spent the next two and a half years just kind of doing whatever I thought was fun at the time, but nothing that society would've considered "productive."
        </p>
        <p>Then, at last, and most recently, I started taking <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/learn/lecture/12287468#notes">this</a> online course, to be productive for once, and to finally properly start
          taking steps towards a potential job and/or career.</p>
